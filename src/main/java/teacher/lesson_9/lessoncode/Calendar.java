/*
Detailed explanation of while logic

while (date.getMonthValue() == month) {
This line starts a while loop that continues until the date's month changes. The loop will iterate through all the days of the current month.

System.out.printf("%3d", date.getDayOfMonth());
Inside the loop, this line prints the day of the month (date.getDayOfMonth()) right-aligned within a field of 3 characters. The %3d format specifier ensures that the day is printed using at least 3 characters, creating space for single-digit days.

if (date.getDayOfMonth() == today) { System.out.print("*"); } else { System.out.print(" "); }
This if-else statement checks if the current day being printed (date.getDayOfMonth()) is the same as today's date (today). If it is, an asterisk * is printed next to the day. Otherwise, a space is printed. This marks the current day in the calendar.

date = date.plusDays(1);
After printing the current day, the date variable is incremented by one day using plusDays(1), moving the loop to the next day of the month.

if (date.getDayOfWeek().getValue() == 1) { System.out.println(); }
This if statement checks if the current day (date) is a Monday, indicated by DayOfWeek.MONDAY having a value of 1. If it is Monday, a new line (System.out.println();) is added in the calendar output, indicating the start of a new week in the calendar grid.

This while loop effectively prints the days of the current month in the format:
1 2 3 ...
4 5 6 ...
...
Each row represents a week, and the current day is marked with an asterisk (*). The loop ensures that the days are printed in the correct order and format for the given month. The loop breaks when the month of the date variable changes, indicating the end of the current month.
